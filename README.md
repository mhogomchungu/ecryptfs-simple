Improvements:

0. Have the project hosted at github.

1. Uses cmake as a build system.

2. A bit of code clean up since it now compiles without warnings while using strict compiler options.

3. Fix a bug that causes volumes config path to be at "~/.config/.ecryptfs-simple"
   instead of at "~/.config/ecryptfs-simple"

4. Make the project work while not started from the terminal.
